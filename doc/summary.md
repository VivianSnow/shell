## Suggestions

If U are leaning a OS lecture or 《APUE》 and try to write a your own shell,  I have some suggestions to you:

1. Write a parser first. I was mad when I try to handle mass situation because I didn't write it first.
2. Some GNU library can make realize easy,for example [The GNU Readline Library](http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html), [wordexp(3)](https://linux.die.net/man/3/wordexp)
3. Read 《APUE》repeatedly!
